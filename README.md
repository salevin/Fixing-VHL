# Fixing-VHL
VHL needs to be updated with this chrome extension

Just some messing around, auto deletes html block and kills the javascript timeout modal.

Shortcuts:
Ctrl - C to change what text is being shown in the vocab page
Ctrl - Z to mark a flashcard incorrect or flip it
Ctr - X to mark a flashcard correct or flip it
